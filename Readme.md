### A tutorial on how to use forced aligners and the autovot praat plugin

In this tutorial, I will show you 
1. how to use forced-aligners, 
2. how to bulk-process textgrid files using the *rPraat* package in **R**. 

I will introduce two types of aligners: the general purpose aligners (e.g., the Montreal Forced Aligner) and an aligner for aligning Voice Onset Time (i.e, AutoVOT). 

I am going to show you how to do grapheme-to-phoneme alignment on corpus data. Based on the *autovot.praat* script shipped with the AutoVOT plugin, I created a Praat script called *autovot\_bulk.praat* to help measure VOTs of multiple audio files. 

The handout (the pdf file) was prepared for students who have just started doing speech analysis.
